        <p>Welcome to the pikPal support page. We're here to help you get the most out of your foraging adventures!</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

        <p class="faq-question">Why did my mushroom log disappear from the map?</p>
        <p>To keep the map fresh and relevant, all mushroom logs automatically expire and are removed from the map 24 hours after they are posted.</p>

        <p class="faq-question">How does the "Friends" feature work?</p>
        <p>The Friends feature allows you to find other users who have also chosen to be discoverable. To appear in this list, you must enable the "Allow others to find me" toggle in your Profile Settings. Your location is only used to calculate the distance between you and other users; it is never shared directly.</p>

        <p class="faq-question">How do I add my current location to a new mushroom log?</p>
        <p>When adding a new mushroom, you can manually type in GPS coordinates, or you can tap the "Current" button. This will use your device's current location to automatically fill in the latitude and longitude fields, provided you have given the app permission to access your location.</p>
        
        <p class="faq-question">How do I delete my account?</p>
        <p>You can permanently delete your account and all of your data by navigating to the Profile tab, then tapping Settings. At the bottom of the Settings screen, you will find a "Delete My Account" button. Please be aware that this action is permanent and cannot be undone.</p>
